# Lung-disease-detection

It is a basic Lung Disease Detection model that predicts whether the input Chest Radiograph is Pneumonia.
But the Accuracy is 1.000 means it is 100% accurate on the testing dataset. But after calculation on another dataset the accuracy is 83.5%. 

You can download the  zip file and extract it and open that folder in the terminal or
Write the command on your Terminal "git clone https://github.com/vishvasingh/Lung-disease-detection.git "
Then write "cd Lung-disease-detection"
Then write "pip install -r requirements.txt"
then run python3 app.py
It has a trained model already -"pneumonia_model.h5"
Download Dataset from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia?resource=download"
But if you want to train the model yourself by using  model.py "python3 model.py"
